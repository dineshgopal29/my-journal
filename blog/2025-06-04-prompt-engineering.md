# 🧠 Prompt Engineering Deep Dive – Techniques, Tools & Best Practices

## 📘 Introduction

Prompt engineering is the art and science of crafting inputs that guide Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce desired outputs. While anyone can write a prompt, effective prompt engineering requires an understanding of LLM behavior, configuration tuning, and iterative testing.

Based on Google’s 2024 whitepaper, this guide breaks down strategies, parameters, and real-world examples to help you get the most from any LLM.

## ⚙️ LLM Configuration Essentials

| Setting         | Description                                            | Tips                                             |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Temperature** | Controls randomness in output                          | Use `0` for deterministic, `0.9+` for creativity |
| **Top-K**       | Sample from top K tokens                               | Lower K for focus, higher for diversity          |
| **Top-P**       | Sample from top tokens within cumulative probability P | 0.9–0.95 is a good balance                       |
| **Token Limit** | Controls max length of output                          | Impacts cost and clarity                         |

✅ **Recommended defaults**: `temperature=0.2`, `top-P=0.95`, `top-K=30`.

## 🧪 Prompting Techniques (with Examples)

### 🔹 Zero-Shot Prompting

**Use:** Simple tasks where the model can generalize well.

**Prompt:**

```
Translate this to French: "Where is the nearest restaurant?"
```

---

### 🔹 One-Shot Prompting

**Use:** When the model needs guidance on format or tone.

**Prompt:**

```
Example:
Input: "What is the capital of France?"
Output: "The capital of France is Paris."

Now, answer this:
Input: "What is the capital of Japan?"
```

---

### 🔹 Few-Shot Prompting

**Use:** Tasks with variability; adds consistency by showing patterns.

**Prompt:**

```
Q: What is 5 + 3?
A: 8

Q: What is 12 - 4?
A: 8

Q: What is 9 + 6?
A:
```

---

### 🔹 System Prompting

**Use:** Guide output format, tone, or persona via system-level instruction.

**Prompt:**

```
You are a JSON API assistant. Always respond in valid JSON format.
User: "Tell me the current weather in London"
```

---

### 🔹 Role Prompting

**Use:** Assign a personality or function to steer response style.

**Prompt:**

```
You are a helpful personal finance advisor.
What’s a good way to save for retirement in your 30s?
```

---

### 🔹 Contextual Prompting

**Use:** Provide real data or background to ground the answer.

**Prompt:**

```
Here’s the company’s 2023 HR policy: [insert excerpt]

Based on this policy, can an employee carry over unused vacation days to next year?
```

---

## 🔁 Advanced Prompting Strategies

### 🔸 Step-Back Prompting

**Prompt:**

```
Let’s first reflect on the broader question:
"What factors should we consider before choosing a new CRM platform?"

Now, given those, which platform is best for a mid-sized SaaS startup?
```

---

### 🔸 Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

**Prompt:**

```
Q: Jane has 5 apples. She buys 7 more, then gives 3 to her friend. How many apples does she have now?
A: Let's think step by step...
```

---

### 🔸 Self-Consistency

**Approach:**

* Run the same prompt multiple times.
* Use majority voting to find the most consistent answer.

**Prompt (run 3x):**

```
What’s the next number in this sequence: 2, 4, 6, 8, ?
```

---

### 🔸 Tree-of-Thought (ToT)

**Use:** Let the model explore multiple branches of reasoning.

**Prompt:**

```
You are solving a puzzle. First, generate 3 different strategies to solve it. Then evaluate which one is most effective and explain why.
```

---

### 🔸 ReAct (Reason + Act)

**Use:** Combine reasoning with tool use.

**Prompt:**

```
User: What’s the weather in Tokyo right now?

Assistant Thought: I need to look up the weather using the weather API.

[Call: GET https://api.weather.com/tokyo]

Action: Retrieve weather info  
Observation: It’s 22°C and sunny  
Answer: The weather in Tokyo is currently 22°C with clear skies.
```

## 💻 Prompting for Code Tasks

Prompt engineering also works well with LLMs like Gemini or Claude for tasks like:

* Writing Bash scripts
* Explaining code
* Refactoring
* Translation (e.g., Python to JavaScript)

**Prompt Example:**

```
Convert the following Python list comprehension to a standard for loop:
[ x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0 ]
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices Summary

* 🎯 Be clear, concise, and direct
* 🧱 Use examples where helpful
* 💬 Keep format structured
* 🧪 Test and iterate
* 🧰 Abstract common prompts with variables or templates
* 🔒 Stay aligned with model safety and bias guidelines

---

## 📌 Final Thoughts

Prompt engineering is your superpower when working with LLMs. It's part design, part trial-and-error, and part understanding the model’s training behavior. With the right strategy, even complex workflows become simple, reusable, and reliable.

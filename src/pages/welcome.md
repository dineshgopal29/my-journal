# Welcome to AI Social Journal 🧠💬

Welcome to **AI Social Journal**, a personal blog where I document my journey through the world of Artificial Intelligence. This space is dedicated to learning, experimenting, and sharing insights as I explore the ever-evolving landscape of AI technologies.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Why This Journal?

As I dive deeper into AI — from building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbots to experimenting with agentic assistants — I've found that writing is one of the best ways to reflect, solidify knowledge, and connect with like-minded learners. This journal serves three main purposes:

- 📚 **Learning in Public**: Sharing what I learn as I learn it, including mistakes, insights, and breakthroughs.
- 🛠️ **Hands-On Guides**: Step-by-step guides and practical examples based on real-world experiments.
- 🌐 **Building a Knowledge Base**: A growing archive of AI concepts, tools, and best practices.

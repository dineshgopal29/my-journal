# About Me

## Who Am I?

I’m a technology leader passionate about **innovation, intelligent systems**, and the future of software. Over the years, I’ve led high-impact teams, modernized legacy systems, and championed AI aided automation across enterprise environments. But beyond strategy and architecture, I’ve always been a builder at heart — curious about how things work, and driven to make them better.

Today, I’m channeling that curiosity into **AI** — not just reading about it, but **experimenting, prototyping, and learning by doing**. This blog is where my technical journey intersects with my professional curiosity: a space where I share lessons, roadblocks, and discoveries as I explore what AI can *really* do in the hands of developers.

## What I Bring to the Table

- 🧭 **Vision & Strategy**  
  Experience guiding enterprise-level technology transformations and aligning development with business outcomes.

- 🛠️ **Engineering Depth**  
  From full-stack development to system architecture, I’ve built scalable solutions that power real-world applications.

- 🤖 **AI Enthusiasm**  
  Focused on LLMs, RAG pipelines, intelligent agents, and how AI can augment decision-making and development workflows.

- 🧠 **Lifelong Learning**  
  Always evolving — learning in public, experimenting with emerging tools, and sharing it all along the way.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted a place to:

- 📓 Reflect on what I’m learning in the AI space
- 🧪 Share hands-on experiments and code
- 💬 Connect with others building and learning in public
- 📚 Build a living archive of what works, what doesn’t, and why

Whether you're a fellow developer, a curious technologist, or someone exploring AI for the first time — I hope you find something here that sparks your interest or helps you on your own journey.
